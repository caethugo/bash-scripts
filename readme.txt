Explanation about this repo : 

This is a way to store some bash scripts I have to write for my Software Engineering course. 

On September 26th 2022, I added :

- an image classifier which gets the .JPG files from a folder and put them in different folders according to their creation date

- a pdf information giver which tells us how many pages they are in pdfs from a given folder and its subfolders, the answer being given by descending file size

- other stuff...
